# telicent-access API

The ACCESS API is formally defined using the OpenAPI Specification in
[`swagger.json`](./src/router/swagger.json) locally or
[`swagger.json`](http://localhost:8091/api-docs/swagger.json) on the server. It
primarily allows the ACCESS front end or other applications to send queries
relating to user and group information and their relevant permissions. API calls
can be tested using the [`Swagger documentation`](http://localhost:8091/api-docs/)
where more detail of the data structures can also be found.

## Running the API Server

For instructions on running the ACCESS API server, please see
[_Build / Install_ in README.MD](./README.md#build--install) in the
telicent-access root directory.

## Error Reporting

The API returns JSON which communicates when an error is encountered servicing
an API request. This should provide sufficient information for API callers to
meaningfully address the error in many cases. A simple JSON structure is
returned, including an error code and message as below:

```json
{
  "code": ###,
  "message": "Error message"
}
```

Some example error responses are shown below:

### Invalid Request

_Invalid request_ error can occur when incomplete query data is sent:

```json
{
  "code": 400,
  "message": "Invalid request / Fields missing"
}
```

### Not Found

_Not found_ errors for the various data types:

```json
{
  "code": 404,
  "message": "Group(s) not found"
}
```

### SCIM Not Enabled

Shown when the System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) is required to
perform an operation:

```json
{
  "code": 405,
  "message": "SCIM is not enabled on this server"
}
```
