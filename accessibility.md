# Accessibility Statement

## Our Commitment  
Telicent is committed to ensuring digital accessibility for all users. We strive to provide an inclusive experience and continuously improve accessibility with every release.

## Standards & Compliance  
We aim to conform to the **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 AA** standards 
and follow best practices to enhance accessibility when developing our applications. 

## Accessibility Features  
We want as many people as possible to be able to use our applications. To improve usability for all users, we have implemented:  
- Keyboard navigation support  
- Compatibility with screen readers  
- Clear and consistent navigation  

## Known Issues  
We are actively working on resolving the following accessibility challenges:  

### **Keyboard Navigation & Focus Issues**  
- Visual indicators are missing when tabbing onto some buttons or links. 
- Some buttons cannot be reached through keyboard navigation alone.

### **Screen Reader & Labeling Issues**  
- Some buttons are announced incorrectly. 
- Missing form labels in some sections.
- Some icons are missing alternative text.
- Some actions are missing auditory feedback.

### **Color Contrast Issues**  
- Some text has very low contrast against its background, making it difficult to read.  

### **Zoom & Scaling Issues**  
- When zooming in beyond 250%, some content is lost or overlaps incorrectly.  

We are committed to improving these areas to meet **WCAG 2.1 AA** standards and will continue to address the above issues in future releases.
